## Square Two

This is a quick place to get started when you're building a Sinatra app with JWT authentication. I found myself building a lot of microservice-style API applications for myself in Sinatra and wanted to get the boilerplate out of the way. It's not quite starting from square one, but it's close.

### How to use it

- Clone this project
- `rm -r .git`
- `git init`

And you're off on your way.

### Other things

I dunno, open an issue.
